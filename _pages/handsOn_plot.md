## Plot your results (pimba_plot.sh)
When finished with pimba_run.sh, you will be able to generate some basic plots for your results, such as PCoA, rarefaction curves, alpha and beta diversity plots.
You will need only two files that pimba_run.sh will generate and one metadata file that you must provide.

Example of OTU table (otu_table.txt) generated by pimba_run.sh:

Example of OTU Tax assignment (tax_assignment.txt):

![](https://github.com/reinator/pimba/blob/main/Figures/taxresult_example.png?raw=true)

Example of Metadata file (metadata.csv):

![](https://github.com/reinator/pimba/blob/main/Figures/metadata_example.png?raw=true)
  
 The first column must always be “SampleID” and the second column must always be “SampleName”

Then, you can run the following command:
```console
./pimba_plot.sh -t <otu_table> -a <tax_assignment> -m <metadata> -g <group_by>
```

`-t <otu_table>` = OTU table generated by pimba_run;\
`-a <tax_assignment>` = Tax assignment file generated by pimba_run;\
`-m <metadata>` = CSV file with columns "SampleID" and "SampleName", and other attributes related to each sample;\
`-g <groupby>` = A column from the metadata that will group the results. E.g., Description. Do not specify if one does not want to group the results.\
  
 Example:
```console
./pimba_plot.sh -t unionTriplicatas_otu_table.txt -a unionTriplicatas_otus_tax_assignments.txt -m mapping_file.csv -g Description
```
